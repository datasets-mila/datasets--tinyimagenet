MicroImageNet classification challenge is similar to the classification
challenge in the full ImageNet
`ILSVRC <http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index>`__.
MicroImageNet contains 200 classes for training. Each class has 500
images. The test set contains 10,000 images. All images are 64x64
colored ones.

Your objective is to classify the 10,000 test set as accurately as
possible.
